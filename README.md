# MNIST

This repository demonstrates my analysis on MNSIT dataset. Work of this repo is inspired from Chapter 3 of Orielly's ML book. 
1. Compared the performance of classifiers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Random Forest Classifier on the dataset.
2. Used diifferent performace metrics like Accuracy, Precision-Recall and ROC-AUC
3. Build both a binary and multi-class classifier
4. Used column standardization techniques
5. Talked about precision-recall tradeoff and how we should not rely on ROC Curves when data is skewed

## Results
1. RF performs better than SGD

## Future Scope
1. Try feature engineering to improve the performance of classifiers
